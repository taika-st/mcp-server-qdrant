# Milestone 1: Config flag and Outlook tool suite wiring

**JJ Change ID**: tnxrwywo
**Parent Message**: FEAT: add outlook schema tools for qdrant collections of email
**Implementation Date**: 2025-09-09 14:25
**Status**: ✅ Success

## What Was Attempted
Introduce a selectable enterprise tool suite with a new Outlook email tool set alongside the existing GitHub code search tools, controlled via configuration. Ensure appropriate payload indexes are created idempotently for the selected suite.

## Files Modified / Added
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/settings.py`
  - Added `ToolSettings.tool_suite` and `QdrantSettings.tool_suite` (env: `ENTERPRISE_TOOL_SUITE`) with values `github|outlook`.
  - Added Outlook tool descriptions and exposed via `ToolSettings`.
  - Wired filterable field accessors to return GitHub or Outlook fields based on suite.
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/enterprise_config_outlook.py` (new)
  - Defined Outlook email filterable fields (`email.*`) and accessors.
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/outlook_tools.py` (new)
  - Implemented `search_emails`, `analyze_mailbox`, `find_threads` for email collections.
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/mcp_server.py`
  - Imported Outlook tools and registered either GitHub or Outlook tools based on suite.
  - Maintained GitHub wrappers and behavior; added Outlook wrappers with JSON array parsing for `labels` and `focus_terms`.

## Discoveries & Deviations
### Documentation & Prior Work
- Leveraged prior enterprise indexing behavior: payload index creation is idempotent and called before search, covering new Outlook fields (via `make_indexes()` and `QdrantConnector`).
- Existing themes full-text semantics guided the Outlook `text` field handling for `email.subject` and `email.to` (soft-OR via Filter.should).

### Scope Adjustments
- Chose separate Outlook config module for clarity and isolation.
- Did not add date-range filters in this milestone; `email.date` supported as equality. Range support can be added by storing numeric timestamps or adding derived fields.

## Technical Decisions
- Suite selection occurs in both `ToolSettings` and `QdrantSettings` (env: `ENTERPRISE_TOOL_SUITE`) to drive tool registration and payload index schema selection consistently.
- Outlook field keys are nested (e.g., `metadata.email.subject`) to align with ingestion payload structure and indexing path conventions.

## Testing Results
- Ran full test suite: `uv run pytest -q` → **118 passed**. No regressions introduced.
- No Outlook-specific tests yet; smoke-tested wiring via type checks and registration code-paths.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add Outlook registration tests (e.g., with `ENTERPRISE_TOOL_SUITE=outlook`, assert tool names present and GitHub tools absent).
- [ ] Add filter mapping tests for Outlook (e.g., `email.from`, `email.labels`, `email.subject` as TEXT should build expected Qdrant filters).
- [ ] Update README to document the new flag and Outlook tool names/parameters; include config example.
- [ ] Consider date range filters by adding numeric epoch fields or ISO date string prefixes.

## Rollback Instructions
- Revert `settings.py` changes (remove tool_suite and Outlook descriptions).
- Remove `enterprise_config_outlook.py` and `outlook_tools.py`.
- Revert `mcp_server.py` tool registration changes.
