# Milestone 1: Schema/Filters update to support full-text themes

**JJ Change ID**: zmsstzsq
**Parent Message**: FEAT: Add full text search to theme tags so search-repository doesn't require exact match
**Implementation Date**: 2025-09-01 19:46
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial

## What Was Attempted
- Add first-class support for text fields and full-text matching for `metadata.themes`.
- Ensure themes matching does not exclude entries lacking the field; treat it as a soft preference.

## Files Modified
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/settings.py` – Added `"text"` to `FilterableField.field_type`.
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/common/filters.py` –
  - Map `text` → `PayloadSchemaType.TEXT` in `make_indexes()`.
  - Build `MatchText` conditions and place them in `Filter.should` for soft OR semantics.
  - Preserve existing behavior for other field types.
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/enterprise_config.py` – `themes` changed to `field_type="text"` with updated description.
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/enterprise_tools.py` –
  - Merge filters now includes `should`.
  - Fallback: if a themed search returns no results and `should` exists, retry without `metadata.themes` in `should`.
- `src/mcp_server_qdrant/mcp_server.py` – Manual merge path now preserves `should` conditions.

## Discoveries & Deviations
### Behavior
- Using `Filter.should` for themes achieves the desired "prefer matching themes" without excluding entries missing `themes`.
- A fallback query ensures we still return results if themed search yields none.

### Open Considerations
- Confirm whether Qdrant `MatchText` yields substring behavior (e.g., `auth` → `authentication`) with current analyzer; if not, we may augment semantic query with theme tokens as a recall helper.
- Case-insensitivity to be validated; likely handled by analyzer, but we can normalize lower-case in tests.

## Technical Decisions
### Why This Approach
- Keeps repository scoping strict (`must`) and themes as ranking preference (`should`).
- Minimal changes outside filters/indexing and tool glue.

### What Didn't Work
- N/A (first pass)

## Testing Results
```bash
# Pending – will run after this milestone
```
- Expected to update/add tests for partial theme matching and fallback behavior.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add tests for partial match (e.g., "auth" matches "authentication"), empty/missing themes, and fallback.
- [ ] Validate case-insensitive matching and, if needed, add semantic query augmentation with theme tokens.
- [ ] Update tool descriptions and README to document partial matching and non-exclusion behavior.

## Rollback Instructions
- Revert changes in the listed files to the previous commit.
- Rebuild without `PayloadSchemaType.TEXT` indexes for `metadata.themes`.
